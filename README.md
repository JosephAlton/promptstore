# PromptStore

## About

With most AI chat interfaces to submit your prompt you use the "Enter" key... So when you do a new line, if you forget to press "shift" then it submits the chat.

This extension is just somewhere to put your text (which will persist) and copy it when you needed. You could also use it to make a quick note.

Why bother? Well, accidentally entering prompts means:
• energy use, LLMs aren't computationally efficient, nor are you guaranteed a suitable result, so take a lot of energy to do the basic things, even just a simple "web search".
or what most people are actually going to case about:
• Waste our usage credits, whether they be free/paid.
